## How you can help

Converting the SRD into a universal format that everyone can use will be quick work if everyone takes a chunk. Knowledge of the markdown and asciidoc formats is preferred but not required. (You get bonus points if you can do pull requests on Github.) I'll be happy to help you through any rough spots.

1. Let me know you want to help by sending me a message at oestii [at] yahoo [dot] com.
2. Pick one (or more) of the sections above under Status to do and I'll assign it to you as an Issue.
3. Pull out the relevant text from `source/SRD-OGL_V5.1.md` and convert it to markdown
4. Send me the file(s) or do a Pull Request for this project.
