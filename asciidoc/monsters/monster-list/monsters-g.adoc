warm breeze, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or
carrying.

*Create Whirlwind.* A 5-­‐foot-­‐radius, 30-­‐foot-­‐tall cylinder of
swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120
feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains
concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the
djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving
throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60
feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with
it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the
whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If
the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to
the nearest space outside the whirlwind.

piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks

*Damage Immunities* cold, necrotic, poison

*Condition Immunities* charmed, exhaustion, frightened, grappled,
paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained

*Senses* darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11

*Languages* any languages it knew in life

*Challenge* 4 (1,100 XP)

*Ethereal Sight.* The ghost can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when
it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

*Incorporeal Movement.* The ghost can move through other creatures and
objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force
damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

===== Actions

*Withering Touch.* _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. _Hit:_ 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage.

*Etherealness.* The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material
Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in
the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can’t affect or be affected
by anything on the other plane.

*Horrifying Visage.* Each non-­‐undead creature within 60 feet of the
ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be
frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also
ages 1d4 × 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself
on a success. If a target’s saving throw is successful or the effect
ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost’s Horrifying Visage for
the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a _greater
restoration_ spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.

*Possession (Recharge 6).* One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5
feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed
by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated
and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but
doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can’t be targeted by
any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it
retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to
being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s
statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class
features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost
ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an
effect like the _dispel evil and good_ spell. When the possession ends,
the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body.
The target is immune to this ghost’s Possession for 24 hours after
succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

*Berserk.* Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or
fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns
while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no
creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an
object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the
golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or
regains all its hit points.

The golem’s creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to
calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to
hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma
(Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being
berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the
golem might go berserk again.

on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

alter its form.

damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points
equal to the lightning damage dealt.

spells and other magical effects.
