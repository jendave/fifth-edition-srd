\section{Appendix MM-B: Nonplayer
Characters}\label{appendix-mm-b-nonplayer-characters}}

This appendix contains statistics for various humanoid nonplayer
characters (NPCs) that adventurers might encounter during a campaign,
including lowly commoners and mighty archmages. These stat blocks can be
used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.

\hypertarget{customizing-npcs}{%
\subsubsection{Customizing NPCs}\label{customizing-npcs}}

There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your
home campaign.

\textbf{Racial Traits.} You can add racial traits to an NPC. For
example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky
trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn't alter its challenge
rating. For more on racial traits, see the \emph{Player's Handbook}.

\textbf{Spell Swaps.} One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to
replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the
NPC's spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same
spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn't alter an NPC's
challenge rating.

\textbf{Armor and Weapon Swaps.} You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC's
armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage
can change an NPC's challenge rating. Magic Items. The more powerful an
NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession.
An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as
one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing
magic item could alter its challenge rating.

\textbf{Archmages} are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters
dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings
and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those
who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to
practice their magic without interruption.

An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an
archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage
interlopers.

\textbf{Challenge} 8 (3,900 XP)

\textbf{Assassinate.} During its first turn, the assassin has advantage
on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit
the assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

\textbf{Evasion.} If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows
it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the
assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and
only half damage if it fails.

\textbf{Sneak Attack.} Once per turn, the assassin deals an extra 14
(4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has
advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an
ally of the assassin that isn't incapacitated and the assassin doesn't
have disadvantage on the attack roll.

\textbf{Actions}

\textbf{Multiattack.} The assassin makes two shortsword attacks.

\textbf{Shortsword.} \emph{Melee Weapon Attack:} +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. \emph{Hit:} 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must
make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

\textbf{Light Crossbow.} \emph{Ranged Weapon Attack:} +6 to hit, range
80/320 ft., one target. \emph{Hit:} 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the
target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6)
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one.

Trained in the use of poison, \textbf{assassins} are remorseless killers
who work for nobles, guildmasters, sovereigns, and anyone else who can
afford them.

\textbf{Light Crossbow.} \emph{Ranged Weapon Attack:} +3 to hit, range
80 ft./320 ft., one target. \emph{Hit:} 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

\textbf{Bandits} rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans,
or spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease,
or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.

\textbf{Pirates} are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters
interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers
sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation's vessels.

\textbf{Actions}

\textbf{Multiattack.} The captain makes three melee attacks: two with
its scimitar and one with its dagger. Or the captain makes two ranged
attacks with its daggers.

\textbf{Scimitar.} \emph{Melee Weapon Attack:} +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. \emph{Hit:} 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

\textbf{Dagger.} \emph{Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:} +5 to hit, reach
5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. \emph{Hit:} 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing
damage.

\textbf{Reactions}

\textbf{Parry.} The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack
that would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be
wielding a melee weapon.

It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to
keep a gang of bandits in line. The \textbf{bandit captain} has these
qualities in spades.

In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the
\textbf{pirate captain} is a variation of the bandit captain, with a
ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must
mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.

More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A
prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be
treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know
anything of the captain's colorful reputation.

rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

\textbf{Greataxe.} \emph{Melee Weapon Attack:} +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
